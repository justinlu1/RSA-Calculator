# RSA-Calculator
RSA Calculator for MATH135 students

This is a calculator which I made to help solve MATH135-style RSA questions.

It can't really handle large prime values for p and q, although this isn't really an issue for the questions which this calculator is intended to 
help with, since they are designed with primes small enough to compute without a calculator.

I hope that this can help my fellow MATH135 students who are studying RSA and who don't have a good way of checking their answers.
